<h1>A Short Story Of My Life</h1>
<p>Growing up I have always loved sports, I played baseball, football, and basketball. My best sport was baseball by far. However, going into Junior year of highschool I had gotten burnt out of playing baseball 24/7. I decided to take up golf. I entered my first tournament that summer and placed 2nd. I instantly fell in love with the rush and competitivness that came with the sport. I got a scholarship to play at Coastal Georgia but ended up getting hurt my first year there. Now golf is just a game that I play for fun during outings with friends.</p>
<p>My first semester at UGA finally arrived, and I began the search for my niche within the busy campus. As I got to know more of my classmates, I realized there were a lot of other high school athletes who felt the same as me! By asking around, I found a group of students who joined me in signing up for a variety of intramural sports. There are many college students who consider themselves athletes yet do not choose to join an official team. Intramural sports are a great way for these students to come together and join in the spirit of competition.</p>
<p>After my first semester at UGA I have been introduced to many people, activities, and organizations on campus. One group in particular is the business fraternity PSE. Pi Sigma Epsilon is one of Terry's business fraternities that offers alot for their members. Along with social gatherings, service projects, and business competitions, they offer support and connections for young business minded people like myself.<p><b><a href="default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.ugapse.com</a></b></p></p>
